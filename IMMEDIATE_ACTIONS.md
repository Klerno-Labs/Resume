Most resumes fail because they don't pass ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems). Here's what to check:

1. **Formatting** - Avoid tables, columns, headers/footers

3. **File format** - Use .docx or simple PDF
4. **Section headers** - Use standard names (Experience, Education)
5. **Fonts** - Stick to Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman

[Provide specific advice for their resume]

If you want to test your resume's ATS compatibility, I built a free checker at rewriteme.app that analyzes all of this automatically.

Good luck with your search!
