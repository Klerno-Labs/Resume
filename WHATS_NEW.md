## What Was Changed

### Backend Files

**[api/lib/processResume.ts](api/lib/processResume.ts)**
- Added 3rd OpenAI API call for HTML generation
- Generates complete HTML document with inline CSS
- Saves to `resumes.improved_html` column
- Auto-saves to `resume_templates` table

**Database Migration**
- Added `improved_html` column to resumes
- Created `resume_templates` table with indexes
- Tracks: name, style, color scheme, usage count

### Frontend Files

**[client/src/pages/Editor.tsx](client/src/pages/Editor.tsx)**
- Added "AI Design" tab (3rd tab)
- Displays HTML in sandboxed iframe
- Shows loading state during processing

**[client/src/lib/api.ts](client/src/lib/api.ts)**
- Added `improvedHtml` field to Resume interface

**[api/resumes/[id].ts](api/resumes/[id].ts)**
- Returns `improvedHtml` in API response
- Access control: paid users only

## Database Schema

### New Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE resumes
  ADD COLUMN improved_html TEXT;
```

### New Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE resume_templates (
  id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  style VARCHAR(50),           -- modern, classic, creative, minimal
  color_scheme VARCHAR(50),     -- blue, teal, purple, etc.
  html_template TEXT,
  usage_count INTEGER,
  created_from_resume_id VARCHAR,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## How It Works

```
1. User uploads resume
   ↓
2. Three parallel AI operations:
   • Optimize text ✅ (existing)
   • Score/analyze ✅ (existing)
   • Generate HTML design ✨ (NEW!)
   ↓
3. Save HTML to database:
   • resumes.improved_html
   • resume_templates (for reuse)
   ↓
4. User sees three tabs:
   • Resume Editor (before/after text)
   • Print Preview (plain text)
   • AI Design ✨ (beautiful HTML)
```
